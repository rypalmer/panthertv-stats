Script Name: vAuthenticate 3.0.1
Author: Vincent Ryan Ong
Email: support@beanbug.net

Description:
vAuthenticate is a revolutionary authentication script which uses
PHP and MySQL for lightning fast processing. vAuthenticate comes 
with an admin interface where webmasters and administrators can
create new user accounts, new user groups, activate/inactivate 
groups or individual accounts, set user level, etc. This may be
used to protect files for member-only areas. vAuthenticate 
uses a custom class to handle the bulk of insertion, updates, and
deletion of data. This class can also be used for other applications
which needs user authentication.

This script is a freeware but if you want to give donations,
please send your checks (coz cash will probably be stolen in the
post office) them to:

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ's)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Q1. Can I add new fields to the authuser database and then just modify the auth.php
	file? I wanted to add fields like email address, birthday, etc. which are user-
	specific.
A1. Technically, you can. However, I extremely advise against doing this because 
	with auth.php being a class, it was meant not to be touched with regard to
	the functions that it contain. A workaround to your concern is to create a new
	table with a foreign key for authuser's uname field. This will be the link between
	the 2 tables. You can then put whatever info you want on the second table.
	To see a script in action which uses vAuthenticate but never modified the 
	authuser and authgroup tables, please see vSignup (available for download at
	the vScripts area in http://www.beanbug.net)

Q2. How do I allow users to sign themselves up instead of me adding them 1 by 1?
A2. vSignup might be more appropriate for your needs. You may download it at the 
	 vScripts area in http://www.beanbug.net.

Q3. What are levels for?
A3. Actually, aside from user level 1, which is the administrator level, this field is for
	informational purposes only. However, you may use this field as the point of
	authentication. Meaning, you may restrict access to a page depending on the 
	level of the user that has logged in (see vAuthenticate.php for case in point).
	If you don't use levels for such a function, it won't have any impact at all.
	Starting on version 3.0, there will be a sample page for implementing 
	authentication on a per-level basis. The file can be found under the members
	folder with a filename of bylevel.php. You may check out the code if you want
	to know more about it. 

Q4. What are groups for?
A4. Just like levels, you may use teams/groups as your authentication point. For example, 
	in vAuthenticate.php, instead of making an if-else statement for the level, we
	may look at the team/group to asses if the user is allowed to view the secured
	page. Starting on version 3.0, there will be a sample page for implementing 
	authentication on a per-level basis. The file can be found under the members
	folder with a filename of bylevel.php. You may check out the code if you want
	to know more about it. 

Q5. What does an "inactive" status mean?
A5. An inactive status makes the specific user unable to login and view the secured areas.

Q6. How do I display the login name or other user details in the secured pages?
A6. If you want to display the username, all you have to do is display $USERNAME via an
	"echo" or a "print" statement. However, if you want to display other details such
	as team, level, or status of the user, you would have to display it like:
	
	echo $check['FIELD']; 
	or
	print $check['FIELD'];

	where FIELD is either team, level, or status.

	You would also be using this method if you plan on making if-else statements
	based on the values that any of these field hold.

Q7. I get this error message when I try to login:
	Warning: mysql_fetch_array(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result 
	resource in /some/path/public_html/folder/folder/auth.php on line 54
A7. In PHP, getting an error similar this either means:
	* You have spelled your database name wrong
	* You have spelled your username wrong

	Take note that PHP is case sensitive. UserName is not the same with USERname.
	Going back to vAuthenticate, re-check your authconfig.php and auth.php and see
	if you have spelled those correctly.

Q8. I’m testing vauthenticate, and the only thing I can get out of it, is: 
	Notice: Undefined variable: username in D:\WWW\auth\vAuthenticate.php on line 43
	Notice: Undefined variable: password in D:\WWW\auth\vAuthenticate.php on line 43
A8. This is basically resolved by making sure that you have register_globals set to "On" in your
	PHP.ini file (If you are making use of a web host and does not have direct access to
	the PHP modules and PHP.ini file, ask your Web Host to turn this feature on).
	
	* NOTE: Starting on version 3.0, vAuthenticate will work even with register_globals
	            turned off.

Q9. How do I create a backup of my data?
A9. If you have phpMyAdmin in your website, you can create a dump for your data. This will
	show you the SQL statements that can be executed to restore the data. For more
	information on this, please consult your phpMyAdmin users manual.

Q10. Why are there 2 administrator accounts instead of just 1 (only sa)?
A10. This is for backup purposes. Just in case you forgot the sa password, there's another
	user who has administrative rights assuming that you did not create new admin
	accounts.

Q11. Can I delete the sa and admin accounts?
A11. No. Both cannot be deleted.

Q12. Can I delete the test account?
A12. No. Actually, there's no logical explanation for this but it wouldn't hurt if it just sits
	there.

Q13. Does vAuthenticate work for sites using an IP address instead of a domain name?
A13. Starting on version 3.0, sites using an IP address would be able to use vAuthenticate.

Q14. Does vAuthenticate provide data encryption?
A14. No. However, starting on version 3, the password field is now encrypted to provide
	a more secure authenticating medium.

Q15. Why is the password field left blank after selecting a username from the list found
	on the right portion of the page in authuser.php?
A15. Since the password field from the DB is encrypted, auth.php was modified to recognize 
	that if you leave the password empty upon pressing the Modify button, it won't 
	change the existing password for the user. However, if you put some value into
	the said field, auth.php would set it to that value.

Q16. How can I protect a page that is outside the directory where vAuthenticate.php is
	stored? For example: 
		DOMAIN: http://www.mysite.com
		vAuthenticate INSTALLATION: http://www.mysite.com/vAuth
		MEMBERS' DIRECTORY: http://www.mysite.com/members
		vAuthenticate ADMINISTRATION: http://www.mysite.com/vAuth/admin
A16. Basically, this is how vAuthenticate's security works. We set the user session after
	the user clicks on the button to login. This will call vAuthenticate.php which 
	stores the username and password in 2 cookie variables which will be used 
	throughout the site. As with cookies, you can only use its value wherever
	you set it and all the subdirectories under the directory where you've set it. 
	Referring to your example, you won't be able to secure your members' directory
	since it is outside the directory where you are setting the cookies 
	(http://www.mysite.com/vAuth).
	
	To get around this, we need to do 3 things:
	1. Move/Copy vAuthenticate.php from http://www.mysite.com/vAuth to the root
		directory which is http://www.mysite.com. With this, we can be sure
		that our cookies are set in the root directory.
	2. Modifiy authconfig.php's $resultpage variable to accommodate the new 
		path to the file. This should be relative to the login file. If you are going
		to use the login.php file provided with the vAuthenticate package, you'd
		have to set $resultpage to something like "../vAuthenticate.php"
	3. Modify vAuthenticate.php to accommodate the path to auth.php and 
		authconfig.php. If we're going to use the example above, instead of 
		having these lines on line 41 and 42:

	  	include_once ("auth.php");
		include_once ("authconfig.php");
 
		You need to change this into:
	  	
		include_once ("vAuth/auth.php");
		include_once ("vAuth/authconfig.php");
 
		
	* NOTE: Remember that all values on A16 are all based on an example. You have to
		change this according to your setup.

Q17. After changing the password in the members' area, why am I booted out of my session?
A17. This happens to anyone (including admins) who tries to modify their password while
	they are logged in. This is because as far as the cookies are concerned, they 
	contain the username and password combination you used when you logged in.
	After changing your password, the system updates the authuser database which 
	would make your current session username and password not match with the ones
	in the database. You would have to login again after changing your password.

Q18. I pulled up the login screen and attempted to login but it gives me a "Page not Found" 
	error with the url of http://www.somedomain.com/<?%20print%20$resultpage%20?>. 
A18. This is because the page where you have the login portion has a .html extension in its filename
	instead of .php (or .php3 or .phtml).
	
Q19. I installed vAuthenticate and executed createdb.sql successfully. However, when I try to login,
	I get an error stating that the username and password I entered does not match or that I 
	entered the wrong password.
A19. The first thing you need to check is of course, that you're entering the correct username and
	password combination. These are case sensitive so "access" is not the same as "Access".
	After this, you need to go to your DB Manager (phpMyAdmin, for example) and make sure that
	ALL columns in your authuser table is in small caps. There are instances where the level and 
	status fields become "LEVEL" and "STATUS" respectively (automatically done by MySQL). If
	any columns (NOT the actual table valeus, mind you) are in capital letters, rename them 
	to have all small caps.

Q20. I have some questions that are not listed here. Where can I contact you for support?
