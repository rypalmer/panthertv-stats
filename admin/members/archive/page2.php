# Description:
# vAuthenticate is a revolutionary authentication script which uses
# PHP and MySQL for lightning fast processing. vAuthenticate comes 
# with an admin interface where webmasters and administrators can
# create new user accounts, new user groups, activate/inactivate 
# groups or individual accounts, set user level, etc. This may be
# used to protect files for member-only areas. vAuthenticate 
# uses a custom class to handle the bulk of insertion, updates, and
# deletion of data. This class can also be used for other applications
# which needs user authentication.
#
# This script is a freeware but if you want to give donations,
# please send your checks (coz cash will probably be stolen in the
# post office) them to:
